# cmsi186-lab01-movie-mixup

## Background

Since you live in LA, you decide to look up which films have the highest domestic gross earnings (adjusted for inflation) and who the star actors were in each movie, browsing photos of the actors so you can match names to faces.

Fortunately you're not starting from scratch and your LMU film and television friends have provided you with the top-10 all-time films and actors. Unfortunately, some of the files have gotten mixed up...

Not to worry! With the *command line*, you'll have them fixed in no time! :)

## Task

Make sure every movie is in the correct genre folder (note: there might be multiple genres that fit, so feel free to make copies of some movies and put them into multiple genre folders) and that each movie folder has the right actor inside. Be careful or you might end up watching E.T. looking for Harrison Ford!

You can start by using the GUI (i.e., you can move documents around by clicking and dragging from one folder to another), but once you're comfortable, you should face this challenge straight from the command line.

Congratulations! You've officially learned how to speak computer. Ready to take
it a step further? Let's talk extensions...

## Extensions

0. Once you're sure everything is in the right place, brainstorm other genres, movies, and actors that you want to watch, and add them into your file tree!
1. Mix up all of your files again, then make your way into a movie of your
choice. Reorganize the files again, while **staying** in that movie.

## What to turn in

0. On the handout provided in class, write down all the commands you used to organize the file. Don't worry about efficiency--you should feel free to explore! Include commands such as ```ls``` or ```pwd``` that helped you to figure out where everything was located.
1. If you did any extensions, write down the commands you used for those as well.
2. Push all the directories with their newly sorted files to this GitHub repo.
